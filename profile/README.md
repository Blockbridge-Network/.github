# Bridging the Gap Between Innovation and Decentralization  
_Powering Africa's Web3 future — one line of code, one community at a time._

## About Us

BlockBridge Network is a developer-first, community-driven ecosystem onboarding Africa into the decentralized internet.

We’re building tools, running bootcamps, and shipping projects that matter — from on-chain microfinance to token-gated education and DAO-powered social change.

> We don’t just talk Web3. We build it.
