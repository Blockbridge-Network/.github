## About Us

BlockBridge Network is a developer-first, community-driven ecosystem onboarding Africa into the decentralized internet.

We‚Äôre building tools, running bootcamps, and shipping projects that matter ‚Äî from on-chain microfinance to token-gated education and DAO-powered social change.

> We don‚Äôt just talk Web3. We build it.
